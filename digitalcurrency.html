            Digital currencies exhibit properties similar to traditional 
            currencies, but generally do not have a classical physical 
            form of fiat currency historically that you can directly hold
            in your hand, like currencies with printed banknotes or minted 
            coins - however they do have a physical form in an unclassical
            sense coming from the computer to computer and computer to 
            human interactions and the information and processing power 
            of the servers that store and keep track of money. This 
            unclassical physical form allows nearly instantaneous 
            transactions over the internet and vastly lowers the cost 
            associated with distributing notes and coins for example 
            of the types of money in the UK economy 3% are notes and 
            coins, 79% as electronic money (in the form of bank deposits).
            Usually not issued by a governmental body, virtual currencies
            are not considered a legal tender and they enable ownership
            transfer across governmental borders.

            The development of digital marketing is inseparable from technology development.
            One of the first key events happened in 1971, when Ray Tomlinson sent the 
            first email, and his technology set the platform to allow people to send and 
            receive files through different machines.However, the more recognizable period 
            as being the start of Digital Marketing is 1990 as this was where the Archie search
             engine was created as an index for FTP sites. In the 1980s, the storage capacity of
              computers was already big enough to store huge volumes of customer information. 
              Companies started choosing online techniques, such as database marketing, rather 
              than limited list broker.These kinds of databases allowed companies to track customers
              ' information more effectively, thus transforming the relationship between buyer and seller.
               However, the manual process was not as efficient.In the 1990s, the term Digital Marketing was
                first coined,.With the debut of server/client architecture and the popularity of personal 
                computers, the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications became a significant 
                factor in marketing technology.[12] Fierce competition forced vendors to include more service 
                into their software, for example, marketing, sales and service applications. Marketers were also 
                able to own huge online customer data by eCRM software after the Internet was born. Companies could 
                update the data of customer needs and obtain the priorities of their experience. This led to the 
                first clickable banner ad being going live in 1994, which was the "You Will" campaign by AT&T and 
                over the first four months of it going live, 44% of all people who saw it clicked on the ad.

            One way marketers can reach out to consumers, and understand their thought process is 
            through what is called an empathy map. An empathy map is a four-step process. The first
             step is through asking questions that the consumer would be thinking in their demographic.
              The second step is to describe the feelings that the consumer may be having. The third 
              step is to think about what the consumer would say in their situation. The final step is 
              to imagine what the consumer will try to do based on the other three steps. This map is 
              so marketing teams can put themselves in their target demographics shoes.[95] Web Analytics
               are also a very important way to understand consumers. They show the habits that people 
               have online for each website.[96] One particular form of these analytics is predictive
                analytics which helps marketers figure out what route consumers are on. This uses the 
                information gathered from other analytics and then creates different predictions of 
                what people will do so that companies can strategize on what to do next, according 
                to the people's trends.
